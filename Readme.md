Done with views. Currently attempting to refactor and condense all views onto one view controller.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most challenging part of this project was figuring out what each part of the functions meant, and how to use them.
If the app was not designed with the correct views from the beginning, it is incredibly difficult to refactor.
